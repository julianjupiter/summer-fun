Summer Fun is a microframework for Java.

```java
public class SampleApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SummerFunApplication app = new SummerFunApplication();

        app.get("/users", (request, response) -> {
            String users = "[{\"id\": 1, \"lastName\": \"Rizal\", \"firsName\": \"Jose\"}," +
                "{\"id\": 2, \"lastName\": \"Bonifacio\", \"firsName\": \"Andres\"}," +

             response.json(users);
        });

        app.run(() -> {
            System.out.println("Application is running on port " + app.getPort());
            System.out.println("Press any key to stop the server...");
        });
    }
}
```

* Uses Grizzly HTTP Server framework, a component of [Grizzly](https://javaee.github.io/grizzly) NIO framework which has been designed to help developers to take advantage of the Javaâ„¢ NIO API.
* Lightweight
